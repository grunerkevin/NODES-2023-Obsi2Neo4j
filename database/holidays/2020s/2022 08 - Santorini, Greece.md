## August 2022

# Sunday 7th August

Woke up early (4am) to get to [[Gatwick]] from parents house. Flew over after a breakfast burrito. Arrived in [[Santorini]] and picked up the car (Peugeot 305 convertible) and drove to a restaurant close to the [[Airbnb]] to meet the host - also went down the wrong street and had to do a scary 967 point turn. Had a Greek salad and beer until she arrived. Checked into our villa, had a swim and a sunbathe before [[Bella]] napped. Then had dinner with [[Alissa]], [[Amos]], [[Adrienne]] and [[Lidia]] of kebabs, souvlaki and dips.

# Monday 8th August

Woke up late and then relaxed in our villa having a swim, a read and a sunbathe. Around midday we travelled to where [[Bella]]‚Äôs family were stay and spent the afternoon in the pool with them. Then [[Lon]] went off for a wine tasting tour with his family and visited three wineries with a tour guide called Angello and three American ladies. Tried some great wines paired with food and bought back a bottle of rose and a sweet wine. [[Bella]] meanwhile chilled at her families villa before going out to dinner with them for moussaka and then having a late night pool party until 1am.

# Tuesday 9th August¬†

[[Lon]] drove over to [[Bella]]s family villa to pick her up, then we went grocery shopping, before returning to our villa for lunch. Had a very chilled day around the villa, sunbathing reading and a naked pool swim. Then went out to a traditional Greek taverna (the Good Heart) for food with both sides of the family. Lovely meal and everyone got on well with [[Floyd]] and [[Adrienne]] bonding the highlight. Came back to the villa for some Rose on the rooftop.

# Wednesday 10th August

Woke up casually and had a swim and a read. Then drove to a bakery close to the wedding venue for a pre wedding meeting. Visited the venue and finalised timings before having lunch at the bakery. Came home and chilled. Had dinner at the nearby restaurant and ate far too much so lay in bed and watched [[Netflix]].

# Thursday 11th August

Wedding day! We chilled around the house all morning, swimming, sunbathing and napping, waiting for the main activities to start. Drove to [[Bella]]s parents for lunch and then took the ladies to the venue to have their hair and makeup done. Meanwhile [[Lon]] went to his parents to get ready. Then, just after 5pm we all met at the venue, [[El Viento]] and began the ceremony. The celebrant could barely speak English which was hilarious but we just about managed through our vows with [[Bella]]s bringing tears to peoples eyes. [[Floyd]] then presented the rings in a small box and we were declared married. We cut the cake and drank Prosecco before setting off for a photo shoot in the nearby village of [[Megalochori]] where we took lots of photos instructed by the photographer. We returned to [[El Viento]] and had our first dance to ‚ÄúBetter Half of Me‚Äù before doing speeches ([[Adrienne]] and [[Lon]]) and eating a four course dinner (Greek salad, meatballs, lasagna and baklava and cake). After dinner we had fireworks and Greek dancers before smashing plates. Then we continued to disco until midnight when everyone left and we retreated to the accommodation at [[El Viento]].

# Friday 12th August

Woke up with the amazing view out across the cliffs and had a swim in the infinity pool before having breakfast brought to us. Packed up and left the venue to return to our villa for a nap. Drove up the top of the hill/mountain to the highest point in [[Santorini]] for the view and visited a small monastery. Tried 4 wines with food at one of the wineries before going out for food with [[Bella]]s family.

# Saturday 13th August

We had a cooking class with [[Amos]] and [[Alissa]] in [[Megalochori]] at 11am. We cooked tzatziki, tomato frittas, Greek salad, shrimp saganaki and a Moussaka before eating it all outside in the sun. Came home and relaxed until going out again with them and [[Adrienne]] and [[Lidia]] to Kamari beach where we had dinner and a cocktail.

# Sunday 14th August

Woke up and had breakfast before heading to the supermarket to get food for [[Bella]]s family who we‚Äôre coming over to our villa to crash until their flight. Played in the pool with [[Floyd]] and chatted with them over lunch until they left around 4pm. Had a drink at the nearby restaurant and then returned for a nap. Drove down to Perissa beach and wandered along the black sand and rocks which [[Bella]] described as if someone had spilled lots of glue in the ocean. Had a couple of banging Gyros pita wraps and some drinks before returning home.

# Monday 15th August

Woke up very early and had a quick breakfast before driving up the island to [[Oia]] where we walked up and down the town looking at the views and shops. Then drove back down the island, stopping at a stoney beach with no one on but bailing as it was sus and then carrying on down to [[Fira]] where we did more walking (couldn‚Äôt turn left as left is for losers) and looking at shops with a bit of food and coffee. Returned back to the villa where [[Bella]] had her daily nap. Chilled for a long time by the pool, really topping up our tan before going into Megalochori for a taverna dinner. Returned back to the villa to watch [[Liverpool]] vs Palace. 1-1 (stupid Nunez red card and worldie Diaz goal).

# Tuesday 16th August

Woke up early and had breakfast before driving to Red beach, and luckily we were one of the first there. It was beautifully clear water and the cliffs were deep red and we swam and then sunbathed until two giant waves managed to reach us. Came back to the villa for lunch and then played in the pool, competing to see who could do the best water gymnastics. In the evening we drove to try to get to White beach but couldn‚Äôt, got mugged off at the petrol station paying for fuel we didn‚Äôt receive and drove to the lighthouse at the tip of the island. Had dinner at the Good Heart again and came home.
