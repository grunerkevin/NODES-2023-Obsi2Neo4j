## June 2022

# Thursday 2nd June

Arrived very early at [[Stansted]] airport and sat in the terminal for hours. Saw Jen and Dan. Flight was delayed and when we arrived we got a local taxi to the [[hotel]], who gave us lots of suggestions, arriving around midnight.

# Friday 3rd June

Woke up late and had a fancy ass breakfast before walking to Schonbrunn palace. Decided it was too expensive to go in, so walked the gardens to the [[Zoo]] instead, to see Koalas, Pandas and Polar Bears. Then went back to the [[hotel]] room, had a nap and went to the pool and spa and had a laugh with the tired [[Spa]] receptionist man. For dinner we tried 2 separate schnitzel places, both too booked, tried another 3 recommendations from Tripadvisor before ending up in a burger restaurant. Then had an awkward drink in the [[hotel]] bar.

# Saturday 4th June

Had another late breakfast and walked to the Museum of Illusions which was great. Walked around the historic centre, refused to pay Â£5 for a fridge magnet, stopped for a beer and drink and then got the tram to the Belvedere Palace. Paid the cheapest entrance fee for the lower palace to see the artwork all about [[Venice]] weirdly. Walked back to the [[hotel]], had a nap, went to the gym and then the spa. Had excellent schnitzel at [[Lidia]]â€™s recommended spot and then had cake in another restaurant before getting kind of caught in the rain. Then had a big old bath in the fancy ass bathtub.

# Sunday 5th June

Woke up early and went to the gym together followed by the pool where we raced each other (20m times: [[Lon]] 13s, [[Bella]] 21s). Had breakfast at the [[hotel]] and then got train to [[Bratislava]]. Walked around the old historic centre, bailed on walking up to the castle and then went to the airport. Landed at [[Luton]] and then had to taxi to [[Stansted]] to drive home.
