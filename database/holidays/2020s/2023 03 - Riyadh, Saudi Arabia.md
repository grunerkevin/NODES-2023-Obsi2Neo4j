## March 2023

A work trip with Ian for meetings in [[Riyadh]] for CEER Automotive (via [[RLE]]), flying from [[Heathrow]] with [[British Airways]].

Minimal chances to explore. Main memories were how packed the roads were (15 minutes from [[hotel]] to the office and then 1 hour 45 back in rush hour). Surprised at how much is being built with so few buildings going above three floors.

Key memories:
- A great sit down meal of curried goat that had been cooked under the sand, sat in a small booth with our legs crossed without our shoes (and once cleaned)
