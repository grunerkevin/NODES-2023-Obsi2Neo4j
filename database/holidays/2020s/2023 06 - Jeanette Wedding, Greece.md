## June 2023

# 9th June - 17th June

Flew out from [[Gatwick]] with [[EasyJet]] having met the full group in Wetherspoons feeling like an Ashcombe school reunion.

Hired a car on arrival and drove [[Charlotte|Charlotte]], Maya and Dec to our first nights [[Airbnb]].

Had breakfast the next morning on the beach where Dec’s northern request for a full English breakfast ended up with him receiving camomile tea.

Drove to the Ekatarini Estate for the wedding location which was stunningly beautiful on top of a huge hill with the steepest drive. Shared a room with Dec and [[Parrise]].

First night visited a taverna with all guests and ate wicked Greek food sat with [[Lorraine|Lorraine]], Alice and Phil.

On the wedding day we took a huge party boat trip out around the beaches of [[Corfu]] and swam in some of the bays around the island whilst doing some incredible salmon dives off of the boat. Wrapped up the boat trip and headed back to the estate for the wedding.

Got ready into our suits, then [[Charlotte|Charlotte]], myself and Mike organised a perfect system of taxis up and down the hill before a beautiful ceremony with Lee as the official for the ceremony and [[Wm|Wm]]’s vows being far better than [[Jeanette|Jon]]’s. Shat myself waiting for the best men’s speech whilst eating some awesome lamb and terribly dry chicken. Speeches went well and we danced to the silent disco and went swimming in the pool until 5am.

Next day was a full blown pool party along with a tennis tournament at the estate which was great fun.

Then moved accommodation to the villas in TBC where I was sharing with [[Parrise]] again (and loved it). Had BBQs and did a wicked day hiring boats and travelling up and down the island. Tried every cocktail in Dirty Nellie’s bar and ended up in a club which ended up being an under 18s night which was hilarious.

Key memories:
- Dec going flying on the inflatable out at sea when I jumped onto him
- The nightclub when we realised it was an under 18s night
