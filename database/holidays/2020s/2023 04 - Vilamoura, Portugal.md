## April 2023

# 6 Apr, 2023 - 11 Apr, 2023

Joined [[Bella]] and her parents for a relaxing few days in the golf resort of Pestana Vila Sol [[Vilamoura]], chilling and taking long walks into the nearby town of [[Vilamoura]].

Flew from [[Stansted]] to [[Faro]] with [[RyanAir]] and then took a taxi down to the resort arriving late in the evening.

Ate buffet breakfasts by the lake and laughed at how bad people on the driving range were. Played tennis against [[Bella]] and died in the heat.
