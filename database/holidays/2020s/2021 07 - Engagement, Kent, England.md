# Engagement, [[Kent]]

## July 2021

### Saturday 24th July

Drove down towards our [[Airbnb]] in Kent. On the way down, we planned to have an afternoon tea whilst feeding some Llamas. After food, we walked around the gardens and found ourselves on a secluded bench where strangely [[Bella]] thought “This would be a nice place to get engaged”.

We walked back up to the house and [[Bella]] went to the toilet so [[Lon]] ran to the car and grabbed the ring. We asked if there was any walk nearby and the owners said there was a nice lake called [[Bewl Water]] just behind the house.

We walked down towards it and [[Lon]] spotted a point jutting out into the water and so directed us to walk to it, even though it was the opposite direction to what was recommended.

Ring felt like it was burning a hole in my pocket and it was a really hot day and [[Bella]] was in thick clothes but we persevered to the lake edge.

Once we got there, [[Lon]] asked [[Bella]] to take a photo of her looking out across the lake. When she turned around, I was down on one knee and she immediately said yes.

## Key memories

- [[Bella]] asking “Is this real?”, [[Lon]] thinking she meant the ring (which was a plastic ring from Amazon), saying yes and then sorting the confusion
- [[Bella]] loving the chain coming from the water and comparing it to Lord Voldemorts chain
- Expecting people to jump out of the bushes to make it feel more official
- Calling [[Adrienne]] and him being at a house party, being really dismissive of the call but then having the nicest most excited reaction
