## June 2023

# Thursday 1st June

Flew out in the evening and arrived at the [[hotel]] at 10pm. Had a quick drink in the [[hotel]] bar and then went to bed.


# Friday 2nd June

Walked towards our tour meet location and stopped for breakfast. Had a flat white, a mint tea, pain au chocolates and a meat and pear sausage roll with relish.

Met outside a church for the eating walking tour and had a great time walking around The Liberties area of Dublin. Had another sausage meat roll for breakfast, beef toastie for lunch, cod goujons for dinner, a baileys cheesecake and salt ice cream for dessert.

Had a pint of Guinness and another pint in nearby bars including Temple Bar before returning to the [[hotel]] for a nap.

Went back out for some more cod goujons and a taster board of beers before heading into the comedy club. Arrived at the earliest possible time and sat right at the back to avoid being spoken to. Opening act starts and asked if there’s anyone from England. We both scream. Only ones in the room. Immediately questioned. [[Lon]] decides to answer for [[Bella]] to avoid her being embarrassed. Ridiculed for not letter her answer. Great show overall.

Finished with a tapas meal with a banging pork burger and then a chocolate milkshake from Eddie Rockets on the wall home.


# Saturday 3rd June

Woke up and walked to the nearest train station, grabbing a pain au chocolat and a pastry from a nearby cafe. Took the green dart train from Tara Street to [[Howth]]. The weather was incredible and Howth was stunningly beautiful. We walked 6km along the coast and up the cliffs, stopping briefly to dip our toes in the sea.

Returned back to the center for a lunch from the market including a German Hot Dog, a slice of pizza, a chorizo and ballymaloe sauce sandwich, finished with a smarties cookie.

Returned back into Dublin and watched the FA cup final/napped in the [[hotel]] room.

Walked into the south of the city for 5:30 for a Dark Tour of Dublins history and learned about some of the brutal torture provided around Dublin castle including Halving, Blood Eagling and various others.

Finished the tour and walked to Cobblestone pub for live music and finished in GBK as couldn’t find a pie anywhere as too busy.


# Sunday 4th June

Got an early taxi over to the airport to fly home before midday to [[Stansted]], stopping for a hotdog and pint breakfast in the airport. Landed and had a nice lunch at the Bakehouse on the way home.
