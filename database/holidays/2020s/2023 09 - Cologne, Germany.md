## September 2023

# 25 Sep, 2023Â - 27 Sep, 2023

A work trip to visit [[Cologne]] for work for [[RLE]] and to say farewell to [[Lyndon]] before she leaves to join [[Neo4j]].

## Monday 25th September

Flew with [[RyanAir]] from [[Stansted]] after a couple of pints and a pizza at the airport.

On arrival, met up with [[Lyndon]] and [[Harvey]] and had a beer with them in a nearby park. Went out for a Persian meal of kebab before heading to a nearby bar where all of the Germans ordered English beers and I ordered a German beer.

## Tuesday 26th September

Got up early and had a half decent breakfast at the hotel. Caught the train and a bus to the Cologne office and then realised I didn't have my plug adaptor. Probably the third time in Cologne I've now done that. Had to walk into the nearby town of [[Chorweiler]] to buy one.

The full team then went to play Laser Tag which I obviously won both games.

Went for a Thai meal for dinner and had beers afterwards following the teamâ€™s positive meeting with the CEO.

## Wednesday 27th September 

Had the very same breakfast again and made the same hour commute into the office via train and bus.

Sat through a very awkward team meeting where it became clear the team wasnâ€™t as aligned as first thought.

Said goodbye to [[Lyndon]] which hopefully isnâ€™t the last time we see each other.

Key memories:
- Being top of the individual score for Laser Tag and our team winning in both games
- Being referred to as like a lost dog when sat listening to everyone speaking German
