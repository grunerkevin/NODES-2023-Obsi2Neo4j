## February 2023

# Saturday 11th February

Woke up early to get to [[Stansted]] for our 9:50am flight and cramped ourselves into the smallest seats known to mankind. Arrived in [[Edinburgh]] in good time except [[RyanAir]] had lost our bags briefly as the airport staff hadnâ€™t bothered taking the bags to the baggage reclaim as there were only 18 bags which they assumed had been lost property. Caught the tram into the city, which was rammed full of Scottish and Welsh fans for the Six Nations match that day. Had lunch in a small Red Cockerel Cafe where [[Bella]] stole the quiche from an old lady and [[Lon]] tried haggis and some weird christmas cake sandwich thing. Walked through the city and checked into our accommodation before having a nap. Explored the city a little more in the evening, ending up in Franco Manca for [[Bella]] to try a pizza with roast potatoes on.

# Sunday 12th February

Got up and went to grab a breakfast from Sainsburys before lounging around to watch old Top Gear specials. Eventually moved off the sofa to walk up to the Old Town and see the outside of [[Edinburgh]] castle and explore the surrounding streets. Couldnâ€™t find anywhere for lunch and so back to Sainsburys for a packed homemade sandwich and a rest in the flat. Then joined a Harry Potter, Haggis & Horrible Histories tour around the city, visiting the place where JK Rowling had invented Harry Potter (which had burned down â€“ but thankfully they saved JKâ€™s table) and seeing the graveyard where she got names from such as Tom Riddle. Had a delightful steak meal at Hawksmoor using a voucher to minimise the painfully high cost before getting more drinks before bed.

# Monday 13th February

Had a quick breakfast and headed off back up to [[Edinburgh]] Castle for early entry. Outside the castle, [[Bella]] held a tiny little owl called Einstein due to his grey fluffy hair. Entered the castle and downloaded the childrenâ€˜s tour guide and explored the castle before having a delightful Afternoon Tea in the fancy castle restaurant. Then tried to walk off the cakes by walking and climbing 8km up Arthurâ€™s seat and back down, getting lost on the way back down trying to be smart and avoid the crowds. Had a brief rest back at the flat and then headed back out for a burger at the Queenâ€™s Arms, where [[Bella]] weirdly smelt the smoke from her Old Fashioned cloche and watched a successful Merseyside derby.

# Tuesday 14th February

Spent a leisurely morning watching Clarksonâ€™s Farm and waking up slowly on the sofa before checking out from the [[Airbnb]] at 11am. Headed into the Old Town and to the National Museum of [[Scotland ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§]] to explore their exhibits (and use their lockers for our bags). Quickly became tired of the random collection of items so nipped out for a pub lunch of pub grub bites before getting the tram back to the Airport. [[EasyJet]] flight was far more enjoyable than on the way out with a spare seat next to us, although the man in front elbowed [[Bella]]s head and then blocked everyone getting off so he could leave first.
