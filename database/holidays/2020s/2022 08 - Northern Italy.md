## August 2022

# Wednesday 17th Aug

Woke up early in [[Santorini]] and had a quick breakfast before driving to the airport. Had a pastry in the airport before boarding and flying 2.5 hours to [[Bergamo]]. Had a shared pizza for lunch and then checked into our lovely [[Airbnb]]. Walked up into [[Bergamo]] and up into Citia Alta which was beautiful. Visited three churches/cathedrals and then climbed up a castle viewpoint. Had ice cream (papaya) and a mixed up slushy (lemon, orange and toothpaste mint) and then walked back towards the [[Airbnb]] after it started raining. Stopped at a micro brewery for a few strong beers and then returned home to eat the best takeaway pizza weâ€™ve ever eaten.

# Thursday 18th August

Woke up to the heaviest rain, packed up and left our apartment in [[Bergamo]] to drive towards [[Lake Como]]. We stopped in [[Como]] and wandered around to have a drink and walk along the pier, before driving around the whole lake clockwise, stopping for pizza, soup and a decaf espresso and some views, finishing in [[Lecco]]. Our last leg was up the inside right leg of the lake to [[Bellagio]] where our apartment was. We wandered up into the city, had some cocktails and then a pasta dinner which was delicious.

# Friday 19th August

Had breakfast in our apartment in [[Bellagio]] and then drove to [[Como]] to do a food walking tour with a tour guide called Pier and an Irish couple. Tasted hams, a Prosecco, some Rose, pizza and then polenta with fish, finishing the tour in Piers spice shop drinking coffee. Walked back to the car and drove to [[Milan]] to our new apartment where we then ate the apricot cloud brioche bread we also got on the tour. Had a short nap and then got the Metro into [[Milan]] centre and walked aimlessly around (accidentally walking into a University) before having some cocktails, one of which was Amaro and was awful, before coming back to the apartment. Ordered pizza and watched [[Netflix]].

# Saturday 20th August

Had breakfast on the balcony looking out over [[Milan]]. Travelled into [[Milan]] and begun the online scavenger hunt, discovering churches, a Devils Column (which [[Bella]] wouldnâ€™t let [[Lon]] touch) and an Italian war memorial which was incredible like the Octagon. [[Lon]] got hangry (it was also 33 degrees) and we walked around until deciding to go back to the same cafe we first saw for pastries. Then went to the Museum of [[Leonardo De Vinci]] and Technology which was massive and endless. Then walked back to the Duomo, had a small pizza and toured the Cathedral and climbed it. Returned home to rest and then came back out to a steakhouse where we had pork ribs and steak which was banging.

# Sunday 21st AugustÂ 

Left pretty early to head towards [[Lake Garda]], starting pretty terribly as [[Lon]] drove into the bus lane. Picked up groceries and drove for 2 hours until we reached the lake where we had pizza on a small pier overlooking the lake. Finished the drive up to the top where we arrived at the camp site. Had a long nap, then swam and went into the sauna on the site before walking down into the beautiful town of Riva Del Garda for food in a bar and then ice cream on the walk home.

# Monday 22nd August

Had breakfast outside surrounded by the mountains and then drove to the south of the lake to [[Lake Garda]]â€™s thermal park. Chilled around the thermal pools and swam in them, in the caves and under the various fountains. Ate 3 variant pastries of mozzarella pizza and had an ice cream, before leaving. Were 5 minutes late to the wine tour of 25 people but then had a great tour before we started drinking. Tried 7 wines, rating each out of ten and getting to know the other tour guests such as Maxime, the vibrant and very drunk Dutch girl. [[Bella]] also brilliantly drunk. [[Lon]] trying to stay sober. Drove home and somehow got pulled over by the police but waved away with nothing. Ordered takeaway pizza and schnitzel and watched United beat [[Liverpool]]Â ðŸ™ƒ

# Tuesday 23rd AugustÂ 

Woke up and had breakfast once again outside amongst the views, before leaving the campsite and driving to a small beach (Spiaggia di Torbole) at the top of the lake. Swam in the fresh water for a while before driving down the right hand side of the lake to Castle of Malcesine where we had lunch of bruschetta and pizza. We completed the full drive to Verona and checked in to our room before a quick nap. Then we walked into the centre of Verona and did another scavenger hunt to see the sites, climbing the clock tower and accidentally ending up in mass in one church. Had a dinner of schnitzel with a lot of alcohol (cocktails, wine and 2.5L of beer) before staggering home.

# Wednesday 24th August

Had a quick breakfast in our apartment and then drove from [[Verona]] to our room in Marghera just outside of [[Venice]]. We had some time to kill so we went to Museo del â€˜900, an interactive museum about Italian life which was actually great fun and took some very funny photos of ourselves as Italians growing up. Then we stopped in at the room to drop our bags off before getting the train into Venice. We did another scavenger hunt tour, visiting several churches and squares before stopping for a very expensive beer and Prosecco and being fed lots of free chocolate in a chocolate store, before heading back out the city. Had a pizza and steak for dinner and went to bed.

# Thursday 25th August

Drove to the airport and struggled to operate the manual self service pump but made it on time. Had some final pizza at the airport for breakfast and then flew home.
