## October 2020

# Monday 26th October

Drove up to [[Suffolk]]. Went for lunch at the White Horse with [[Cristopher]], [[Christy]] and [[Floyd]]. Arrived at our [[Airbnb]] cabin. Drove to Aldeburgh and walked along the coast before having cocktails and beers. Made nachos back at our cabin.

# Tuesday 27th October

Went for a run and had breakfast. Met up with [[Cristopher]], [[Christy]] and [[Floyd]] in Southwold and did a Halloween trail searching for the correct beach hut. Went to Snape Maltings and it was incredibly rainy so we had some food in the teepee outside. Had an all day breakfast for dinner back at the cabin.

# Wednesday 28th October

Laid in bed in the morning. Met up with the gang in Framlingham. Drove to Oxford and wandered round in the rain. Grabbed a takeaway curry and Rocky Road from Friday Street Kitchen and ate back at the cabin. Walked to the pub for some drinks.

# Thursday 29th October

Went for a run. Met up with [[Cristopher]], [[Christy]] and [[Floyd]] and did some pottery, painting two tiles. Visited Sutton Hoo and it was very rainy so mainly sat in the cafe. Went to the White Horse for dinner and played games with [[Floyd]].

# Friday 30th October

Got up and packed and then had breakfast at Friday Street Kitchen before driving home.
