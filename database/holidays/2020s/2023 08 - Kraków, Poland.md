# August 2023

## Monday 7th August

Flew out early in the morning from [[Stansted]] with [[RyanAir]] after having a quick pint and breakfast in Wetherspoons. Arrived in [[Krak√≥w]] and waited for an hour for non-EU passport control but at least we have our shores back. Took the train into the centre and found our way to our [[hotel]] room, called Central Palace, which was excellent. Had a quick lunch of pretzels ü•® and then joined a walking tour around [[Krak√≥w]] Old Town, climbing up to the castle to finish. Wandered back down to see the [[Krak√≥w]] dragon blowing flames before heading into the centre to have beers and cocktails in the central square at Europejska cafe. Had a great dinner of ribs, dumplings and cabbage pancakes at Go≈õcinna Chata Restaurant before heading back to bed.

## Tuesday 8th August

Woke up and walked into the nearby train station to grab breakfast from a Carrefour. Took our yogurt and granola back to our apartment and had some coffee and chilled for a bit, booking up activities for the following days. Walked into the town centre, visited the Basilica in the central square and had a lunch of Polish soup in a bread bowl and a chicken broth at Chopin Restaurant. Did a Secret Spy mission walking around [[Krak√≥w]] solving clues and having a laugh, including having to do a secret set of instructions in a public square and whispering a secret word to an undercover agent. Finished the mission successfully and had a beer in the square listening to the Hungarian music for culture day. Walked back to our apartment and [[Bella]] had a nap before still managing to wake up grumpy. Considered a takeaway but managed to get up, shower and walk into the square again to eat at Sioux. [[Bella]] had a steak and [[Lon]] a burger and we quickly evacuated as we thought a gas burner was going to explode.

## Wednesday 9th August

Got up early and had a quick breakfast of granola and yogurt. Caught the train over to visit the Wieliczka Salt Mine and saw the St. Kinga Chapel and various other chambers. Had some pork knuckle, turkey kiev and chips for lunch over 100 metres below the ground. Trained back to [[Krak√≥w]] and had a rest at our apartment. Walked into the old city once again and visited a bar called Hevre which was an old chapel with frescos on the walls converted into a beer house. Tried beer with syrup with ginger and raspberry ([[Bella]] enjoyed, [[Lon]] hated), before drifting into the square for food. Had bruschetta and a really good pizza each at La Grande Mama where [[Bella]] had a honey and apple pizza and [[Lon]] the pizza named after the restaurant. Wandered back to our flat, grabbing an awful rose flavoured donut and better apple/pear and cranberry/pomegranate donut to compensate, finishing with a coffee.

## Thursday 10th August

Woke up slowly and went to drop out bags off at lockers at the station before grabbing a pastry breakfast. Walked into the old town to grab a coffee from McDonalds and meet for the Jewish Quarter walking tour which was very good but finished with a sad story as to why the ghetto finished in 1943. Caught the train back into [[Krak√≥w]] and collected our bags and caught the train to the airport, trying to ignore the incredibly loud family (who then happened to be on our flight). Had a meal in Boccone Trattoria in the airport as [[Bella]] saw it had a robot waiter which served us pizza and beer. Suddenly we heard an announcement about our gate being called early so had to down the beer and pizza as fast as possible. False alarm as it was the plane before us. Otherwise uneventful flight trying to avoid the family. On drive home, tried to stop at the Bakehouse but it was shut so ended up at Vita Bella. Most awkward overpriced restaurant ever. ¬£33 spaghetti with meatballs was very average and waiters all wore white gloves and were creepily attentive and cleaned the table between every meal.

## Key Question
- Where do the horses that carry people around the center shit? There was never any anywhere.

Key memories:
- Laughing doing the set of instructions in the public square for the Spy mission üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- Ordering carbs on carbs on the first night (dumplings and cabbage pancakes)
