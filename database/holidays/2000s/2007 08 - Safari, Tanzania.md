# August, 2007

Flew firstly to [[Nairobi]] to catch our next flight onwards to [[Dar es Salaam]].

Met up with a group and went on [[Safari]] into [[Tanzania ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¿]] seeing Impala, Elephants, Giraffe, Lions and many other animals.

Visited a tea plantation in the mountains and the crossed over by ferry to [[Zanzibar]] for a few days on the beach and exploring the island including [[Scuba Diving]].


Key memories:
- Playing football with the locals on a sand pitch on [[Zanzibar]]
- Donating [[Brockham Badgers]] shirts to a school
- Having a traditional African Warrior guide us to our tent but get lost and get his mobile out
- Having the [[Safari]] staff make me a banner, bake me a cake and give me a musical box instrument for my birthday
- Seeing the poverty in the first city we arrived in, sitting on a bus at night
