# July, 2003

Family holiday to [[Florida]] to visit some theme parks and attractions.

Key memories:
- Swimming with Dolphins and small sharks in Discovery Cove
- Going to the snow styled water park Blizzard Beach
- Riding the furling dragons roller coaster and Superman coaster at Universal Studios
- Playing the Men in Black shooter game and getting top score as I was the only one who pressed the button when told not too
- Visiting the Kennedy Space Center
- Taking an Airboat ride down the Florida rivers to see alligators
- Eating alligator. Tasted like very chewy chicken
- The massive breakfast buffets
- Running from the swimming pool back to our house with a wall of warm rain behind me
- Opening a Star Wars Tie Bomber Lego set for my birthday
- Playing mini golf in incredibly hot conditions
- The minivan we had
