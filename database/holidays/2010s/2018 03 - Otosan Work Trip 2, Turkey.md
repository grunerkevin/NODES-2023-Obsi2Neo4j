Lonely work trip to [[Istanbul]] whilst working for [[Ford]] (via [[RLE]]) visiting the [[Ford]] Otosan manufacturing plant. Flew with [[Pegasus]] and stayed at the Ramada Plaza in Izmit.

Key memories:
- "Golden ears" bloke in Otosan plant telling me my rear check arm was too loud (it wasn't) and Otosan rejecting the new cost saving design - actual reason was that they couldn't actually correctly paint it
