## August 2017

# 20 Aug, 2017Â -Â 25 Aug, 2017

A full week on the south coast of [[France ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡·]] for [[Lon]] and [[Bella]] with a brief excursion to [[Monaco ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡¨]] also. Flew from [[Stansted]] with [[EasyJet]].

Key memories:
- The pasta meal that caused us to need to remortgage but tastiest pasta ever eaten
- Running a mile every morning along the seafront. [[Lon]]s shoes were too big and couldnâ€™t run so he just sprinted and stopped, sprinted and stop
- Visited an [[Aquarium]] near the castle
- The 300 degree train journey to [[Monaco ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡¨]]
