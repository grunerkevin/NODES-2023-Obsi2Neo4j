## December 2019

# 6 Dec, 2019 - 9 Dec, 2019

A long weekend up in [[Edinburgh]] to explore the city and see how much we could drink apparently.

Key memories:
- Drinking on the train journey up
- Trying desperately to scoop my own vomit out of the blocked sink
- [[Peter]] arriving late that evening and all being hideously drunk. I greeted him on the street in my boxers and then we all went out for a burger at [[Lorraine]]s burger where no one finished their burger
- Ditching going into the castle to go to a whiskey tent in the Christmas market
