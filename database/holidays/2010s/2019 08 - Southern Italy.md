## August 2019

# Monday 19th - Naples

Flew out early on 6am flight. Landed and were collected by Patrizio and driven madly through [[Naples]] to our [[Airbnb]]. Walked miles through Naples to the port and then stopped in a cafe to eat pizza and buffalo mozzarella. Found a domed shopping centre and met a man who couldn‚Äôt speak but explained the star signs on the floor and made us spin round next to the Virgo sign and make a wish. Went back to the flat for a nap and then walked out for the evening to eat a cone of fried food and a rum baba.

# Tuesday 20th - Naples

Woke up and went for a run up a steep hill to some gardens. Walked back down and had breakfast. Walked to [[Naples]] botanical gardens. Had lunch in the flat and napped. Walked to the catacombs of [[Naples]] which were empty of bodies. Had pizza for dinner and pistachio ice cream and limoncello pastry cone for dessert.

# Wednesday 21st - Naples/Pompeii

Picked up the car (Toyota Corolla) and drove to [[Pompeii]]. Walked into [[Pompeii]] and had mini pizzas with salami for lunch. Walked around the ruins of [[Pompeii]]. Rudely pushed past lots of people and got shouted at by a tour guide. Walked home and napped for too long. Walked into [[Pompeii]] and had pizza, spaghetti carbonara and melon and ham for dinner. Visited [[Pompeii]] town square and then had a pastry and limoncello slushie before going home.

# Thursday 22nd - Pompeii/Sorrento

Ran to the beach front of [[Pompeii]]. Drove along the [[Amalfi Coast]] across Fiordo di Furore, and onto [[Positano]]. Walked down to [[Positano]] beach and ate a pizza and bruschetta. Walked back up and drove onto [[Sorrento]]. Put our fancy clothes on and went for dinner in town in a restaurant where they rolled their eyes at us. Lasagna and veal was tasty though.

# Friday 23rd - Sorrento/Rome

Had bread and ham for breakfast on the terrace. Drove as far up [[Mount Vesuvius]] as we could and then walked the remainder of the way up to the crater. Drove to [[Rome]] passing the [[Vatican City üáªüá¶]]. Walked into the centre to see the Spanish Steps and the Trevi Fountain. Had pizza and carbonara pasta for dinner.

# Saturday 24th - Rome/Florence

Woke up early and had yogurt drinks for breakfast. Walked to the Vatican and walked around the Basilica and the Tombs of the Popes. Got fast track entry for the Vatican Museum and Sistine Chapel. Walked as fast as we could through the museum and into the chapel. Both a little disappointed üòî. Drove out of [[Rome]] past the [[Colosseum]]. Visited the Tivoli fountains. Drove 5 and a half hours to get to our house in [[Florence]]. Had a McDonalds as everything was shut when we arrived.

# Sunday 25th - Florence

Woke up without an alarm and went shopping for breakfast lunch and dinner. Came back and had bread and jam before going out to the pool. Chilled in the sun and did a dance competition in the water. Went back into the flat, had a salad for lunch and then had a long nap. Woke up and went back in the pool with some frogs until we got attacked by biting flies. Watch Pirates of the Caribbean whilst drinking wine and beer and then had pesto pasta for dinner.

# Monday 26th - Florence

Woke up late (bliss). Had breakfast of bread and jam with yoghurt. Went for a swim and [[Lon]] did 100 lengths of the pool. Sunbathed. Had lunch of the remaining pesto pasta which was delicious. Napped for a while and watched TV. Did some of [[Bella]]‚Äôs work. Swam some more. Went out for dinner at a local restaurant (Girodibacco) which was the best meal so far. Had a tasty bean salad to start followed by chicken liver starter. Then had pulled pork with roast potatoes which was fucking amazing. Literally. [[Lon]] then said no to dessert like a mental person.

# Tuesday 27th - Florence/Pisa

Woke up early and left the flat. Drove into [[Florence]] and had a sandwich and pastries for breakfast. Walked to the Cathedral Duomo in Florence and then up to Michelangelo‚Äôs viewpoint to have a milkshake. Drove to [[Pisa]] and climbed the Leaning Tower of Pisa before having a pizza and some cold meats with cheese for lunch. Drove to our tipi [[Airbnb]] and had Prosecco in the whirlpool. Had a delicious dinner of four courses; figs and Parma ham and bruschetta, then homemade pasta bolognese, then roast beef with tomatoes and finished with fresh blackberries and ice cream.

# Wednesday 28th - Pisa/Cinque de Terre

Woke up late in the tipi and had a breakfast of eggs on toast and some cakes and biscuits. Drove to the city of [[Lucca]]. Carried onto [[Cinque de Terre]] and rested in the [[Airbnb]] after grabbing a takeaway pizza and pasta for lunch. Walked down through the town to the waterfront and had some pasta on the walk back up.

# Thursday 29th - Cinque de Terre/Genoa

Woke up and had a breakfast of toast, croissants, cake and jam on the patio. Tried to drive to a small beach en route to [[Genoa]], got as far as we could but then realised you couldn‚Äôt drive all the way to it. Instead drove to [[Genoa]] and found a beach. Gambled on the all Italian menu and ended up with tuna pasta (proper fishy tuna though ü§¢) and mussel spaghetti. Went for a swim in the sea. Dropped [[Bella]] off at the apartment and then drove the car to the airport to drop it off, only just remembering to fill it with petrol. They didn‚Äôt look at the scrapes on the front bumper üí™üèª. Rested and then went to the Aquarium. Saw Manatees, sharks and dolphins and [[Bella]] played with a seal. Had dinner in the port area and both had pizza. Walked back to the flat with a crepe and a frappe.

# Friday 30th - Genoa

Had a long lie in and then packed. Walked to find a taxi to the airport. Ordered hot milk by accident rather than a latte. Flew home.
