## February 2018

# 06 Feb 2018 - 09 Feb 2018

First work trip to [[Istanbul]] whilst working for [[Ford]] (via [[RLE]]) visiting the [[Ford]] Otosan manufacturing plant and also a company called Rollmech who produced the Transit V363 rear door hinges. Flew with [[Pegasus]] and stayed at the Ramada Plaza in Izmit.

First trip was with Drew Arkwright and involved a lot of work and time at the plant and meals back in the Irish restaurant in the [[Hotel]].

Key memories:
- Being promised to be taken out for a nice Turkish kebab and somehow always ending up eating in the Irish bar at the downstairs of the hotel
