# August, 2012

A sporty family holiday to the Greek island of [[Lemnos]] with a family.

Key memories:
- Water skiing for the first time and seeing a dolphin below me and thinking it was a shark
- Competing in a boat regala with [[Adrienne]] and capsizing several times
- Being too embarrassed to do a family photo on the beach. Luckily we did it and itâ€™s on the wall of my parents house now
