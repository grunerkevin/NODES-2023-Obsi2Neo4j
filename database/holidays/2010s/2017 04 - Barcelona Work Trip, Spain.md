# April, 2017

A couple of days in [[Barcelona]] whilst working for [[Ford]] (via [[RLE]]) visiting a company called Flex-n-Gate who produced the Transit V363 check arm.

Had meetings with a chap called Juan (who didn’t believe I was old enough to be the correct person when he met me at the airport) and then went out and explored [[Barcelona]] alone that evening.

Saw the outside of the La Sagrada Familia whilst eating pizza but overall felt too nervous of being pickpocketed to really enjoy myself.

Stayed at Núñez i Navarro [[Hotel]].

Had a final day of meetings, drank far too much caffeine and had heart palpitations on the plane home.

Key memories:
- The coffee was very good to be fair
