Another work trip to [[Istanbul]] whilst working for [[Ford]] (via [[RLE]]) visiting the [[Ford]] Otosan manufacturing plant. Flew with [[Pegasus]] and stayed at the Crowne Plaza in [[Istanbul]].

Travelled with Max and Simon.

Key memories:
- Pretending to be dating whilst having cocktails with Simon
- Drinking beer and watching Simon smoke a cigar larger than his head sat looking out across the river in [[Istanbul]]
